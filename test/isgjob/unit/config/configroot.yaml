# These are job templates for job manager. Each call of create_job function will create a new job.
# Additional job command arguments and labels can be injected when calling create_job function.
# The created jobs are monitored by job manager for termination (succeeded or failed).
# The completed jobs will be deleted by job manager after a preset period under framework setting.
# In case of pod failure, the job never restarts the pod. The job is considered complete but failed.
# It's up to the microservice business logic to decide how many jobs to create in parallel.
# The requested parallelism (.spec.parallelism) on job configuration can only be set to 1 for now.

  # The maximum running time for a job before API issues error in log.
  # Optional setting. Default 1800 seconds.

  # How long to keep a failed job
  # Optional setting. Default 120 seconds.
  keeping_failed_job_time: 60  # seconds
  # How long to keep a succeeded job
  # Optional setting. Default 120 seconds.
  keeping_succeeded_job_time: 30  # seconds
  # Required setting. A unique name for job manager

  # Maximum number of active jobs, spawned by this microservice.
  # Once the number of active jobs reaches this number,
  # KafkaConsumer is paused.
  # Optional setting. Default is 3 jobs.

  # This is the namespace where jobs will be deployed in k8s cluster
  # Optional setting. Ignored if job manager is running in K8s
